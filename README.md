# MY FIREFOX RICE
~~Stolen~~ Taking inspiration from [this codeberg repo](https://codeberg.org/awwpotato/potatofox).

## How to use

Click on the link above and read there.
If you wanna change colors then maybe like scroll around for a while until you find the colors and change them.
OR you can do like
```bash
find . -name '*.css' -type f -exec sed -i s/#hex1/#hex2/g {} +
```
Where hex1 is the hex of the color you want to replace and hex2 is the hex of the color you want it to be replaced by.
This will probably not be enough. Maybe need to change some RGB values too, or opacity and stuff. but yeah.

## How to make websites fit the theme?

See [this](https://codeberg.org/colrobloxkid69420/Stylus) for codeberg or [this](https://github.com/colrobloxkid69420/Stylus) for github.
It is kinda make-do though. ~~(just like this rice)~~
